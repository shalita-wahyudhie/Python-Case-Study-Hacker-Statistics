# Case Study using Hacker Statistics

In this notebook, I use **Hacker Statistics** to simulate and find the chances of winning a bet.

### The Game

You and your friend are climbing the stairs of your office building when you decided to play a game. The game is, each of you will throw a dice 100 times to determine your next step. If the dice is 1 or 2, you have to go down one step. If the dice is 3, 4, 5, you get to go up one step. And if the dice is 6, you have throw the dice one more time and go up as much as the new number you get. You make a bet that ypu will reach 60 steps high. While playing this game, when need to consider additional factor and rule. That is we can't go below the 0th step, and that we can fall down the steps with a factor of clumsiness 0.1%. Now the question we wish to solve is, what are the chances that we will win this bet?
